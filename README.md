These are the scripts I wrote to make myself useful.

### UFP - Revised

Unread Forum Posts - Revised is the main reason I made this github account, so the users can have the latest version of the script at all times. I made several changes since I started writing the script, here's what it's good for.

* [x] Adding gradient background to forums / subforums
* [x] Adding highlights to threads
* [x] Removing forums / subforums from the results
* [x] Removing threads from the results
* [x] Whitelisting threads if the parent forum is removed
* [x] Switch to see removed forums/subforums/threads
* [x] Timer for automatic page reload
* [x] Settings backup
* [x] New coloring system
* [ ] Add-on to make changes directly from threads

### BBCode - ColorPicker

This color picker lets you change font-color where you can use BBCode. There is an `<input type="color">` button before the `[color=][/color]`. You have to choose a color, then use the original color button to add the new color to the textarea.

### Not Tiny Searchbox

It's a quick fix for those who are using one of the delicious stylesheets. The search box was a bit too small and for me it was not annoying, but it was for some, so I decided to fix that.

### External links on new tab

Is a feature who don't want to navigate from the site, if an AniDB, Wiki, MAL, MangaUpdates or ANN link is clicked. Any link pointing to these sites will open on a new tab.
